# MICROCONTROLLER-BASED-CURRENT-PROTECTION-CIRCUIT-WITH-WI-FI-MONITORING

Every circuit requires some kind of protection from the conditions such as overload and short 
circuit which occurs because of the overload on circuit or overcurrent flowing in a circuit. 
Over current or excess current is a condition where a larger than intended electric current 
exist. This leads to excessive generation of heat and risk of fire or damage to circuit. So in 
order to protect the circuit from these conditions we go for protection circuit which prevent 
both power supply and load from getting overloaded or short circuit.  
 
1 Overload 

 An overload condition occurs when there is an electric fault in a system that results in 
abnormally high amounts of current but far less than a short circuit.  In other words, 
an overload fault results in significantly reduced resistance, but resistance that also 
remains significantly above 0 – unlike a short circuit fault.

 Every electric circuit in a wiring system must be protected against overloads.  A 
circuit overload occurs when the amount of current flowing through the circuit 
exceeds the rating of a particular device. The amount of current flowing in a circuit is 
determined by the load for current. 

 For example, if a circuit is rated for 15 amps maximum, then a fuse or circuit breaker 
of that rating will be in that circuit. If the current exceeds 15 amps, the circuit breaker 
opens and cut off the current flow. Without the overload protection wires can get hot, 
or even melt the insulation and start a fire.

 There are two kinds of protection for electrical units that need to be considered 

1. The first is concerned with the protection of the actual electrical wires supplying 
the circuits against an overload above their carrying capacity

3. The second type is concerned with protecting the individual appliances and 
electrical equipment connected to a supply circuit from an overload.
 
 The effect of any overload is an increase in temperature of both load and power 
supply with a drastic reduction of its life time. With proper protection circuit we can 
prevent bad situations for power supply or loads and making them last long and 
efficient. 
                             
2 Short Circuit 

 A Short circuit is when a very low resistance path is created, causing enormous 
amount of current. For example, when a live wire touches a neutral wire, it creates a 
short circuit.

 When the human body is introduced as the path of least resistance, the current travels 
through the body. Short circuits can cause injury or death through electrical shock, 
electrocution, or fires. 

 More power is demanded during a short circuit, causing electrical arcs and extremely 
high temperatures that can melt plastics or set fire to flammable materials such as 
wood or fabrics. 

 As we know short circuit will damage power supply and the load or even creates 
a worse condition for the circuit if specific protection is not provided. This can occur 
due to improper design / connection of circuit or inadequate insulation in the circuit. 
 Due to the above determined effects of short-circuiting it is desirable and necessary 
to provide some kind of protection circuit.
